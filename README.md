# ngSlides

With ngSlides I want to provide a possiblity to write easily slides for a presentation using html.

In a single html-file a presentation is segmented like this:

	<presentation>
		<slide>

		</slide>
		<slide>

		</slide>
	</presentation>
	
With the angularjs controllers there are control-buttons and -keys provided to cicle throught the slides.
Also the number of the actual slide and the number of all slides are displayed.

You can jump to slide number x by adding the following to the url:
#?slideNo=x
